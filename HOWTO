How to build this project:

1. Create files to make sure they will not break build:

$touch NEWS README AUTHORS ChangeLog

2. The following command (below) run "aclocal", "autoconf", "autoheader" and "automake" in the right order to create config.h.in, Makefile.in, configure and a number of axiliary files:

$autoreconf --force --install

3. Creates Makefile from Makefile.in and config.h from config.h.in

$./configure

4. Finally build your project using make command

$make

How to run McPat:

This McPat project was modified to allow running lots of statistics dumps in one call.
First the McPat will configure the system components and parameters, and then it will expect in the stdin stream the xml-input-stats file.
This way it is possible to have it integrated with other tools, like the gem5 performance tool.

1. Command line to run it separately.

$./mcpat -infile <xml-config> -print_level <level of output details 0-5> < <xml-input-stats>

xml-config: this file can have only the structure of the system (components plus parameters).
xml-input-stats: this is the file where the stats values will be.
